API Reference
=============
.. _api.functions:
Connections
-----------
The :func:`connect` function is the primary entry point for the SingleStore
package. It connects to a SingleStore database using either
`DB-API <https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/>`_ compliant parameters,
or a connection string in the form of a URL.
The :func:`create_engine` function is used with the SQLAlchemy package
to create an SQLAlchemy engine for SingleStoreDB connections. This is
primarily for use in environments where the connection parameters are
stored in environment variables so that you can create SingleStoreDB
connections without specifying any parameters in the code itself.

Connection
..........
Connection objects are created by the :func:`singlestoredb.connect` function. They are
used to create :class:`Cursor` objects for querying the database.

   Connection.close

   Connection.rollback
   Connection.cursor
   Connection.is_connected
   Connection.enable_data_api
   Connection.disable_data_api
The :attr:`Connection.show` attribute of the connection objects allow you to access various
information about the server. The available operations are shown below.

ShowResult
^^^^^^^^^^
The results of the above methods and attributes are in the form of a
:class:`ShowResult` object. This object is primarily used to display
information to the screen or web browser, but columns from the output
can also be accessed using dictionary-like key access syntax or
attributes.

   ShowResult
Cursor
......
Cursors are used to query the database and download results.  They are
created using the :meth:`Connection.cursor` method.

Uploading from streaming sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While the standard way of loading a local file using ``LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE``
is well-known, it is possible to load data from programmatic sources
as well. This means that you can generate data with a Python function
and load that data into the database without writing it to a file
first. Below are two methods of doing this. Both of them use the
``local_infile=true`` parameter on the connection and the ``infile_stream=``
option on the ``cursor.execute`` method.
Uploading data using a generator function
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
.. sourcecode:: python
   conn = s2.connect('s2-host.com/my_db?local_infile=true')
   cur = conn.cursor()
   def upload_csv():
       yield '1,2,3\n'
       yield '4,5,6\n'
       yield '7,8,9\n'
       # Note that the data returned does not have to
       # correspond to a single row. Any length of
       # data can be returned.
       yield '10,11,12\n13,14,15\n'
   cur.execute('CREATE TABLE generator (a INT, b INT, c INT)')
   cur.execute(
       '''
       LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE ':stream:' INTO TABLE generator
           FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
       ''',
       infile_stream=upload_csv(),
   )
Uploading data using a queue and threads
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
.. sourcecode:: python
   from queue import Queue
   from threading import Thread
   conn = s2.connect('s2-host.com/my_db?local_infile=true')
   cur = conn.cursor()
   data_feeder = Queue()
   cur.execute('CREATE TABLE queue (a INT, b INT, c INT)')
   t = Thread(
       target=cur.execute,
       args=(
           '''
           LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE ':stream:' INTO TABLE queue
               FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
           ''',
       ),
       kwargs=dict(infile_stream=data_feeder),
   )
   t.start()
   data_feeder.put('1,2,3\n')
   data_feeder.put('4,5,6\n')
   data_feeder.put('7,8,9\n')
   # Note that the data sent does not have to
   # correspond to a single row. Any length of
   # data can be sent.
   data_feeder.put('10,11,12\n13,14,15\n')
   # Send an empty string to end the data loader.
   data_feeder.put('')
   t.join()

Management API
--------------
The management objects allow you to create, destroy, and interact with
workspaces in the SingleStoreDB Cloud.
The :func:`manage_workspaces` function will return a :class:`WorkspaceManager`
object that can be used to interact with the Management API.

Notebook Tools
--------------
The SDK includes a `notebook` sub-module for tools that are for use in
the `SingleStore Managed Service Portal Notebooks <https://portal.singlestore.com>`_
environment. The following objects in `sinlgestoredb.notebook` are
singletons that automatically track the organization, workspace group, workspace,
stage, and secrets that are selected in the portal.
These objects act just like the corresponding objects discussed in previous
of this documentation (including attributes and methods), but they proxy all
calls to the currently selected portal services.

Server Tools
------------
It is possible to start a SingleStoreDB server from the Python SDK in a
couple of ways: Docker or Cloud Free Tier. Both of these methods are
described below.
Docker
......
If you have Docker installed on your machine, you can use the Docker interface
included with the Python SDK to start a SingleStoreDB server in Docker. This
allows you to open interactive shells, SQL Studio, and also use the `%sql`
magic commands from Jupysql with a SingleStoreDB server running in a container.
An example of starting SingleStoreDB in Docker is shown below.
.. sourcecode:: python
   from singlestoredb.server import docker
   s2db = docker.start()
   with s2db.connect() as conn:
       with conn.cursor() as cur:
           cur.execute('SHOW DATABASES')
           for line in cur:
               print(line)
   s2db.stop()
It is possible to use the server instance as a context manager as well.
This will automatically shut down the container after exiting the ``with``
block.
.. sourcecode:: python
   from singlestoredb.server import docker
   with docker.start() as s2db:
       with s2db.connect() as conn:
           with conn.cursor() as cur:
               cur.execute('SHOW DATABASES')
               for line in cur:
                   print(line)
If you do not explicitly shut down the container, it will get shut
down when the Python process exits.
.. currentmodule:: singlestoredb.server.docker
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/
   start
   SingleStoreDB.logs
   SingleStoreDB.connect
   SingleStoreDB.connect_kai
   SingleStoreDB.connection_url
   SingleStoreDB.http_connection_url
   SingleStoreDB.kai_url
   SingleStoreDB.studio_url
   SingleStoreDB.open_studio
   SingleStoreDB.open_shell
   SingleStoreDB.open_mongosh
   SingleStoreDB.stop
Cloud Free Tier
...............
The Cloud Free Tier interface works much in the same way as the Docker
interface, although it doesn't support as many features. To start a
server in the Cloud Free Tier, you use the following:
.. sourcecode:: python
   from singlestoredb.server import free_tier
   s2db = free_tier.start()
   with s2db.connect() as conn:
       with conn.cursor() as cur:
           cur.execute('SHOW DATABASES')
           for line in cur:
               print(line)
   s2db.stop()
Just as with the Docker interface, you can also use a Python
context manager to automatically shut down your connection.
.. currentmodule:: singlestoredb.server.free_tier
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/
   start
   SingleStoreDB.connect
   SingleStoreDB.connection_url
   SingleStoreDB.http_connection_url
   SingleStoreDB.kai_url
   SingleStoreDB.open_shell
   SingleStoreDB.open_mongosh
   SingleStoreDB.stop
Configuration
-------------
The following functions are used to get and set package configuration settings.
Execute the :func:`describe_option` function with no parameters to
see the documentation for all options.
.. currentmodule:: singlestoredb
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/
   get_option
   set_option
   describe_option
In addition to the function above, you can access options through the
``singlestoredb.options`` object. This gives you attribute-like access to the option
values.
.. ipython:: python
   import singlestoredb as s2
   s2.describe_option('local_infile')
   s2.options.local_infile
   s2.options.local_infile = True
   s2.describe_option('local_infile')
.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:
   s2.options.local_infile = False
