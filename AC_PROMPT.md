# AutoClaude Implementation Session

You are now in an AutoClaude implementation session. Your task is to implement the specification according to the AC_PLAN.md plan.

## Specification Details
**Title:** Summary
**Project:** singlestoredb-python
**Branch:** udf-json

## Your Task
You are running in the project directory with all necessary context. Please:

1. **Review @AC_SPEC.md** - This contains the original specification
2. **Review @AC_PLAN.md** - This contains your implementation plan
3. **Implement each task** systematically, checking off items as you complete them
4. **Test your implementation** where appropriate
5. **Update AC_PLAN.md** - Mark completed items with [x] instead of [ ]
6. **Create a commit when finished** - See commit instructions below

## Guidelines
- Work incrementally, implementing one feature at a time
- Test frequently to ensure everything works
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Create new files only when necessary
- Update existing files when appropriate
- Run any tests that exist in the project

## Commit Instructions
**IMPORTANT:** When you have completed the implementation and all tests are passing:

1. Stage all your changes: `git add .`
2. Create a commit using this message format:
   ```
   {spec_type}: {spec_title}

{spec_summary}
   ```

   Replace:
   - `{spec_type}` with "feature"
   - `{spec_title}` with "Summary"
   - `{spec_summary}` with a brief summary of what was implemented

   Example commit command:
   ```
   git commit -m "feature: Summary

   [Brief summary of implementation]"
   ```

## Session Information
- **Working Directory:** /home/ksmith/src/singlestoredb-python/trees/udf-json
- **Branch:** udf-json

Start by running `ls -la` to see the current project structure, then begin implementing according to @AC_PLAN.md.
